<h2>Welcome to Blocks and Beyond 2015</h2>

<h4>2015 IEEE Blocks and Beyond Workshop<br>
October 22, 2015 &middot; Atlanta, Georgia, USA</h4>

<p>

<p>Blocks programming environments, which represent program syntax trees
as compositions of visual blocks, have introduced programming and
computational thinking to tens of millions, reaching people of all
ages and backgrounds.
Despite their popularity, there has been remarkably little research on
the usability, effectiveness, or generalizability of affordances from
these environments. 

<p>The goal of this workshop is to begin to distill
testable hypotheses from the existing folk knowledge of blocks-based
programming environments and identify research questions and
partnerships that can legitimize, or discount, pieces of this
knowledge. This workshop brings together educators and researchers
with experience in blocks languages, as well as members of the broader
VL/HCC community who wish to examine this area more deeply. 

<!--
Participants have diverse areas of expertise, including
design of programming environments, instruction with these
environments, the learning sciences, data analytics, usability, and
more.

The workshop will be a generative discussion that sets the stage for
future work and collaboration. It will include participant
presentations and demonstrations that frame the discussion, followed
by reflection on the state of the field and smaller working-group
discussion and brainstorming sessions.
