<h1>Organizers</h1>

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">Michelle Ichinco</span> 
recently joined the University of Massachusetts Lowell as an assistant
professor in the Department of Computer Science, focused on the
intersection of Human Computer Interaction and Computer Science
Education. She completed her doctorate with Caitlin Kelleher at
Washington University in St. Louis. Michelle’s work with the Looking
Glass programming environment focused on introducing example code into
open-ended programming through suggested code animations. Michelle’s
current work continues to focus on supporting and understanding
motivation and learning during undirected novice coding.

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">Felienne Hermans</span> 
is associate professor at the 
<a href="https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/">Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science</a>
at Leiden University, where she heads the PERL research group,
focused on programming education. On Saturdays she teaches children
programming in a local community centre. She is one of the organizers
of the <a href="http://www.curry-on.org">CurryOn conference</a>, which aims to bridge the gap between
industry and academia. Felienne was also one of the founders of the
<a href="https://joyofcoding.org/">Joy of Coding conference</a>, with a similar goal, which she organized for
6 years. Since 2016, she has been a host at IEEE <a href="https://www.se-radio.net/">SE radio</a>, one of the
most popular software engineering podcasts on the web.

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">Mark Sherman (co-chair)</span>  
is an assistant professor of computer science at Emmanuel College and
director of their Integrated Digital & Data Sciences initiative. Mark
received his Ph.D. in computer science specializing in CS education
research at UMass Lowell working with Fred Martin, and was a postdoc
researcher at MIT with the App Inventor group. Mark has researched
blocks programming, specifically the detection of student success from
blocks manipulation, impact of languages on learning, and development
of computational identity and computing for social good.
</p>

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">Franklyn Turbak (co-chair)</span> 
is an associate professor of Computer Science at Wellesley College.
His interests include the design, analysis, and implementation of
expressive programming languages, graphical representations of
programs, and the visualization of computational processes. 
As a member of the MIT App Inventor development team and head of the
Wellesley TinkerBlocks research project his current focus is to improve the
expressiveness and pedagogy of blocks-based programming languages. He
is co-author of the textbook Design Concepts in Programming Languages.
</p>

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">David Weintrop</span>  
is an assistant professor in the Department of Teaching & Learning,
Policy & Leadership in the College of Education with a joint
appointment in the College of Information Studies at the University of
Maryland. His research focuses on the design, implementation, and
evaluation of accessible and engaging computational learning
environments. His work lies at the intersection of design, computer
science education, and the Learning Sciences. David has a Ph.D. in the
Learning Sciences from Northwestern University and a B.S. in Computer
Science from the University of Michigan. He spent one year as a
postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago studying computer
science learning in elementary classrooms prior to joining the faculty
at the University of Maryland. Before starting his academic career, he
spent five years working as a software developer at a pair of
start-ups in Chicago.

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">Daniel Wendel</span>  
is a Research Engineer at the MIT Scheller Teacher Education Program,
where he leads the research, design and development of StarLogo Nova,
a blocks-based programming environment designed to enable students and
teachers with little to no prior programming experience to build
agent-based computational models. His research centers on the
integration of computational modeling into science classes, with
current collaborators including Susan Yoon, Bob Coulter, Okhee Lee,
Doug Clark, Corey Brady, and Irene Lee. A co-author with Ricarose
Roque of the Open Blocks blocks language library used by StarLogo TNG
and the first version of Google App Inventor, Daniel has been “around
the block” since his undergraduate work with Eric Klopfer in 2004.
