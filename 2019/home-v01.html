<strong>This section is still being edited for 2019!</strong>

<p> We invite three kinds of paper submissions to spark discussion at the workshop: 

  <ol>

    <li> A 2 to 3 page <b>position statement</b> describing an idea,
    research question, or work in progress related to the design,
    teaching, or study of visual programming environments.</li>


describing an idea, research
    question, or work in progress related to the design, teaching, or study of blocks programming
    environments.
 
    <li> A <b>full paper</b> (4 to 8 pages, including references) describing previously unpublished results
    involving the design, study, or pedagogy of blocks programming
    environments.

  </ol>

We invite three kinds of paper submissions to spark discussion at the workshop. 
A position statement (up to 2 pages should we extend this to 3 pages?) 

A short paper (up to 4 pages, excluding references and/or acknowledgments) or long paper (up to 8 pages, excluding references and/or acknowledgments) describing previously unpublished results involving the design, study, or pedagogy of visual programming environments.
To maximize discussion time at the workshop, paper presentation times will be very short. Actual times will depend on the number of accepted submissions but are estimated to be in the range of 3 to 5 minutes for position papers, 4 to 7 minutes for short papers, and 6 to 10 minutes for long papers. 
For all kinds of papers (including position statements), an abstract must be submitted to the Easy Chair Blocks and Beyond  2019 workshop submission site by the end of 12 Jul 2019.
Completed papers must be submitted as PDF files to the Easy Chair Blocks and Beyond workshop submission site by the end of 19 Jul 2019. Use an IEEE double-column conference template to format your submission.
We do not use a double blind review process, so submissions should include author information.
As with previous Blocks & Beyond workshops, we plan to publish accepted papers as an IEEE workshop proceedings. Publication will require submitting an IEEE copyright form. 


<p>For either kind of paper, an abstract must be submitted to the 
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=blocksbeyond2017">
Easy Chair Blocks and Beyond workshop submission site</a> by the end of 19 Jul 2017.

<p>Completed papers must be submitted as PDF files to the
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=blocksbeyond2017">
Easy Chair Blocks and Beyond workshop submission site</a> by the end of 26 Jul 2017. 
Use an 
<a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Conference template</a>
to format your submission. 

<p>Submitted paper abstracts and PDFs can be updated at any time through 
the end of day on 26 Jul 2017 (anytime on Earth). Authors are encouraged
to submit drafts that can be updated until the 26 Jul deadline. 
Drafts should be indicated by putting <code>Draft:</code> at the 
beginning of the title in the paper. 

<p>As with the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/mostRecentIssue.jsp?punumber=7359188">
Proceedings of the First Blocks and Beyond Workshop</a>, 
we plan to publish the proceedings of the Second Workshop 
with the IEEE. 

<p>Some expected differences from the 1st workshop:

<ul>

<li> a single-track format. 
<li> longer full-paper presentation times (tentatively, 15 minutes);
     position statement presentations will be shorter "flash talks"
     (about 5 minutes). 

</ul>

<p> Submissions are not anonymous, so do not anonymize your papers. 

<!--
<p> Because this workshop will be discussion-based, rather than a
mini-conference, the number of presentation/demonstration slots are
limited. Authors for whom presentation or demonstration is essential 
should indicate this in their submission.

<h1>Call for Participation</h1>

<h2>Scope and Goals</h2>

<p>
Blocks programming has become popular in programming environments
targeted at beginner programmers, end users, and casual
programmers. Tens of millions of people have used blocks programming
environments like Scratch, App Inventor, Blockly, Snap!, StarLogo
Nova, Pencil Code, Alice/Looking Glass, AgentSheets/AgentCubes, and
Code.org's curricula.
</p>

<p>
Blocks environments improve learnability and usability by supporting
recognition over recall, reducing cognitive load by capturing
structural patterns as blocks, and using block shapes to prevent
errors in syntax and in static semantics (e.g., out-of-scope variable
names and type errors). Other features typically include browser-based
environments, high-level abstractions, visible state, and easy-to-find
examples.
</p>

<p>
Since blocks are only a small step towards leveraging visual languages
and notations for specifying and understanding computation, the
emphasis of this workshop is on the Beyond aspect of Blocks & Beyond:
what kinds of visual notations and programming environment scaffolding
facilitate: Understanding program semantics? Learning computational
concepts? Developing computational identity and fostering
computational participation and computational action?
</p>

<p>
The goal of this workshop is to bring together language designers,
educators, researchers, and members of the broader VL/HCC community to
answer these questions. We seek participants with diverse expertise,
including, but not limited to: design of programming environments,
instruction with these environments, human factors, the learning
sciences, and learning analytics.
</p>

<p>
This workshop will engage participants to (1) discuss the state of the
art of visual languages targeted at beginners, end users, and casual
programmers; (2) assess the usability and effectiveness of these
languages and their associated pedagogies; and (3) brainstorm about
future directions for these languages.  
</p>

<h2>Suggested Topics for Discussion</h2>

  <ul>

    <li>In what ways have blocks languages succeeded or failed at
    fulfilling the promise of visual languages to enhance the ability
    of humans to express computation?</li>

    <li>How can visual languages and environments better support
    dynamic semantics and pragmatics, particularly with features for
    liveness, debugging, and understanding the dynamic execution of
    programs?</li>

    <li>How usable and effective are visual environments for teaching
    computational thinking and programming? For democratizing
    programming and enabling computational participation and
    computational action? How do we know?</li>

    <li>In what ways does visual programming help or hinder those who
    use them as a stepping stone to traditional text-based languages?
    What are good ways to support the transition between visual
    languages and text-based languages? How important is this?</li>

    <li>How does the two-dimensional nature of visual language
    workspaces affect the way people create, modify, navigate, and
    search through their code?</li>

    <li>What tools are there for creating new visual languages,
    especially domain-specific ones?</li>

    <li>What are effective mechanisms for multiple people to
    collaborate on a visual programming when they (1) are co-located
    or (2) are working together remotely?</li>

    <li>What are effective pedagogical strategies to use with visual
    languages, both in traditional classroom settings and in informal
    and open-ended learning environments?</li>

    <li>What are the most effective ways to provide help to visual
    programmers, especially in settings outside the classroom?</li>

    <li>How can visual environments and associated curricular
    materials be made more accessible to everyone, especially those
    with visual and motor impairments and underrepresented populations
    in computing?</li>

    <li>What lessons from the visual programming community are worth
    sharing with other language designers? Are there features of
    visual languages that should be incorporated into IDEs for
    traditional programming environments? What features of modern IDEs
    are lacking in visual languages?</li>

    <li>How can online communities associated with these environments
    be leveraged to support users? Are these online communities
    inclusive and how can they be more inclusive?</li>

    <li>For these environments, what data can be collected, and how
    can that data be analyzed to determine answers to questions like
    those above? How can we use such data to answer larger scale
    questions about early experiences with programming?</li>
