<h1>Call for Demos and Posters<br>

<div class="notice">
<span class="bbemph2">Important:</span> Although the demo/poster submission deadline
is <span class="bbemph2">Fri. Sep. 22</span>, 
note that early registration ends on 
<span class="bbemph2">Fri. Sep. 8</span>, and hotel rooms are being
held until only <span class="bbemph2">Sun. Sep. 10</span>. 
You are encouraged to take advantage of early registration and hotel reservations!

for details.

<p>Anyone planning to attend the Blocks and Beyond workshop
(Tue. Oct. 10, 2017, in Raleigh, NC) is invited to present a demo
and/or poster in a "blocks playground" session at the workshop. This
is a great way to interact with other attendees and get feedback from
them on your work.

<ul>

<li>If you are not presenting a full paper or position statement at the
workshop, you are especially encouraged to present a demo/poster as a
way to show whatever work you're doing in the area of blocks
programming. It's OK if the work is "in progress" or just at an idea
stage. The important thing is to engage other attendees in a
discussion about the work.

<li>If you are presenting a full paper or position statement, you are
still encouraged to present a demo and/or poster. This could
complement your other presentation (e.g., you could demo a system
that you describe in a talk), or could involve a topic that's completely
different from your talk.

<!--
<li>We tentatively plan to break up the playground into at least two parts so
that everyone will have a chance to see some other demos/posters.  

<li>If possible, we will try to arrange for posters to be displayed during
the whole day of the workshop so that they can be viewed during
breaks. We also hope that those with demos will be willing to show
them during breaks if requested (e.g., by other people who were
presenting at the same time).
-->

</ul>

<p>If you have any questions about the demo/poster session, 
please email Lyn Turbak directly at fturbak@wellesley.edu. 

<h2>Option 1: Short Abstract </h2>

<p>If you intend to present a demo and/or poster, then by <span class="bbemph2">Fri. Sep. 22</span>
you should submit a <span class="bbemph2">short abstract</span>
(at most a few paragraphs) describing your topic to the
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=blocksbeyond2017">
<span class="bbemph2">DemosPosters</span> track of the workshop</a>. 
(Click <span class="bbemph2">New Submission</span> if you already have a 
workshop submission.)
For this option, you do
not need to submit any PDF. Such abstracts will <b>not</b> appear in the IEEE
workshop proceedings but will be posted on the workshop website.

<h2>Option 2: Summary Document </h2>

<p>We also offer the option to submit a longer 
<span class="bbemph2">demo/poster summary document</span> 
that <b>will</b> appear in the proceedings. 
A summary document should be at least one full page and at most two full pages (in double-column IEEE article style). 
It should include a short abstract in addition to the main body text, and should also include appropriate citations 
and references.

<ul> 

<li> In order to maintain a low bar for presenting a demo/poster, a summary
document is completely optional. 

<li> Such a summary makes the most sense
for (1) attendees who are not presenting a full paper or position
statement or (2) accepted authors who wish to present a demo/poster on
a topic different than their full paper or position statement. 

<li>Demo/poster summary documents should be submitted by 
<span class="bbemph2">Fri., Sep. 22</span> to the 
<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=blocksbeyond2017">
<span class="bbemph2">DemosPosters</span> track of the workshop</a>. 
(Click <span class="bbemph2">New Submission</span> if you already have a 
workshop submission.)

<li> Summary documents will be reviewed by the workshop organizers, 
who may require modifications before publication.
Such documents will appear in the
proceedings only if at least one of the authors registers by 
<span class="bbemph2">Wed. Sep. 27</span> and
actually participates in the playground session at the workshop.
Publication will also require submitting a <a href="copyright.html">copyright form</a>.
