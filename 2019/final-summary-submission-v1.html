<h1>Instructions for Final Submission of Demo/Poster Summaries</h1>

<p> You need to do two things to complete the final submission of your Blocks & Beyond Demo/Poster Summary:

<ol>

<li>By the end of day on <span style="color:magenta">Tuesday, October 31, 2017</span>, you must submit your final 2-page demo/poster summary to the PDF eXpress Plus system. <span style="color:magenta">The PDF eXpress Plus account for our workshop closes on Wed. Nov. 1, so this step is very important.</span>. 

<li>By the end of day on <span style="color:magenta">Friday, November 3, 2017</span>, you must submit your IEEE copyright form. 

</ol> 

<h2>Submit Your Final PDF to PDF eXpress Plus</h2>

<p>This must be completed by the end of  <span style="color:magenta">Tuesday, October 31, 2017</span>.

Follow these steps: 

<ol> 

<li><b>Revise Your Submission</b>: 

<p>Revise your submission to address any comments you have received from Lyn. 

<li><b>Format Your Paper</b>

<p>All submissions must be created using the 8.5" x 11" (US Letter), Two-Column Format template (LaTeX or MS Word) provided at the IEEE author site: 

<blockquote><code>http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</code></blockquote>

<p>If you use the LaTeX template, use the following \documentclass declaration; do *not* use the compsoc option.

<blockquote><code>\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}</code></blockquote>

<p>You have a <strong>2-page limit</strong> on your summary document. 

<p>If you added page numbers to your original submission, please remove them from your camera-ready version.<br>

<p><span style="color:magenta;"><b>Note on copyright footer</b>: The IEEE paper submission FAQ says ``A copyright footer must be applied to the paper prior to uploading manuscript to PDF eXpress." However, you do <b>not</b> need to add such a footer in your workshop paper. We will add this footer (with the appropriate ISBN number) when we assemble the papers into a proceedings.</span>

<li><b>Create/validate your submission PDF</b>

<p>All camera-ready submissions must be PDF documents that have been
validated using IEEE's PDF eXpress Plus tool. You can choose either to
let PDF eXpress Plus create your final PDF from source or you can
validate a PDF you have created yourself. Only papers that pass
validation by PDF eXpress Plus are accepted by the IEEE Xplore digital
library.

<ol type="a">

<li>Begin by visiting the PDF eXpress Plus site at: 

<blockquote><a href="http://www.pdf-express.org/plus">http://www.pdf-express.org/plus</a></blockquote>

<ul>

<li>If you've visited this site before, log in with Conference ID <code>43120XP</code> and go to step 3c. 

<li> If this is your first visit to the site, click on the link "New
Users - Click Here" and fill in your information. You will need the
Conference ID, which is

<blockquote><code>43120XP</code></blockquote>

<p>You will also need to specify a password for this particular conference ID. 

<p>Click "Submit" when done and go to Step 3b. 

</ul>

<li> On the Create Account Page, fill in any missing information, click "Submit" when done, and then click "Continue".<br><br>

<li> On the Home -- Title Status page, click "Create New Title" and
enter some version of the title for your paper. (The title is not
official in any way; it is only used by you to distinguish submissions
if you have more than one). Click "Submit File for Checking or
Converting"<br><br>

<li> On the Upload File page, either (1) choose a PDF file to validate
or (2) choose a source file to convert to PDF (e.g. .doc/.docx). Then
click "Upload File" and read the message on the resulting page.

<p>Soon, you should receive an email from the system reporting the status of the validation/conversion. 

<ul>

<li> If the validation/conversion is successful, the email will say
so, but will <b>not</b> include the validated/converted PDF file as an
attachment. To see the validated/converted PDF file, go to step 3e.

<li> If the validation/conversion is unsuccessful, the email will give
hints on how to fix the problem. Go to step 3e and try again. If you
have problem validating a PDF file you saved from a .doc/.docx file,
you might instead try using PDF eXpress Plus to convert the .doc/.docx
file directly.<br><br>

</ul>

<li> Click "Continue" to return to the Home -- Title Status page. This
page shows the status of your paper(s). On this page you can:<br><br>

<ul>

<li> Click on a title to view the validated/converted PDF associated with that title. 

<li> Click on "Try Again" to retry validation/conversion for a paper 

<li> Click "Refresh File Status" to refresh the page.<br><br>

</ul>

</ol>

<li><b>Upload your final submission to PDF Express Plus</b>

<p>This step must be completed by the end of day on <span style="color:magenta">Tuesday, October 31, 2017</span>.

<p>For the B&amp;B 2017 workshop, you will use PDF eXpress Plus (<b>not</b> EasyChair) 
to upload the final version of your submission. 

<ol type="a">

<li> In PDF eXpress Plus, go to the Home -- Title Status page.<br><br>

<li> Click on the "Approve for Collection" link for the title you wish to submit.<br><br>

<li> On the resulting page, labeled IEEE PDF eXpress, you will be able
to change the default File Name for your PDF file. Please ignore the
advice on that page, and name your file using the following
convention:

<blockquote><code><i>lastNameOfPresentingAuthor</i>-<i>firstTitleWord</i>-<i>secondTitleWord</i></code></blockquote>

<p>E.g., presenting author Phil E. Buster of paper "Time Consuming Blocks" would use the <code>filename Buster-Time-Consuming.pdf</code>

<li> Click "Approve File for Collection" to submit your final version.<br><br>

</ol>


<h2>Submit Your IEEE Copyright Form</h2>

<p>This step must be completed by the end of <span style="color:magenta">Friday, November 3, 2017</span>.

<p>The IEEE copyright form is electronic. Go to the <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~blocks-and-beyond/2/copyright.html">Blocks and Beyond 2017 Copyright page</a> to start the proces of submitting your IEEE copyright form.

<p>Unfortunately, the IEEE electronic form was very flakey for the submission of copyright forms for full papers and position statements. Please let Lyn know if you encounter any issues with the form. Previously, the form would sometimes hang near the final step. About half the authors experience this problem while the other half did not. 

<!-- <p><span style="color:magenta; font-weight:bold">Update on Tue. Aug 29: we will post details later today about how to submit your copyright. Because of this delay, we will give an copyright submisiion extension to anyone who cannot complete it by Aug. 30.</span> -->

<!-- <p><i>We are currently exploring using the IEEE's electronic copright submission system (eCF). Details will be posted soon.</i> -->
