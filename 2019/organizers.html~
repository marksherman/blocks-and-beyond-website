<h1>Organizers</h1>

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">Franklyn Turbak</span> 
is an associate professor of Computer Science at Wellesley College.
His interests include the design, analysis, and implementation of
expressive programming languages, graphical representations of
programs, and the visualization of computational processes. 
As a member of the MIT App Inventor development team and head of the
Wellesley TinkerBlocks research project his current focus is to improve the
expressiveness and pedagogy of blocks-based programming languages. He
is co-author of the textbook Design Concepts in Programming Languages.

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">Jeff Gray</span> 
is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University
of Alabama. His main research interests are in software engineering
and computer science education.  Jeff is on the Education Advisory
board of Code.org and also a Code.org K5 affiliate. He is a National
Science Foundation CAREER recipient and an ACM Distinguished
Member. Jeff has served on over 75 conference/workshop organizing
committees and over 200 program committees. Most recently, he has been
involved with the new CS Principles course in the following ways:
national pilot instructor since 2011, NSF PI on a grant that is
training 50 Alabama high school teachers, and a MOOC instructor for
Google CS4HS. His current projects involving blocks languages include
an NSF project that is investigating how children with disabilities
can program in Scratch using “Programming by Voice,” as well as
advising several new Blockly language environments (Spherly for Sphero
robots and Pixly for pixel manipulation). More general information
about his work is at: http://gray.cs.ua.edu.

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">Caitlin Kelleher</span> 
is the Urbauer Career Development Associate Professor of Computer
Science at Washington University in St. Louis. Her work focuses on
democratizing computer programming through innovative programming
tools. Looking Glass is a programming environment designed for ages 10
and up that serves as a platform for exploring how kids can learn
programming even when they lack access to a teacher and classroom
context. It includes tools for interactively exploring the execution
history, capturing and sharing reusable snippets of code, and
generating puzzles from shared code. Caitlin completed her doctorate
at Carnegie Mellon University working with Professor Randy Pausch. She
is the recipient of an NSF CAREER award, a Sloan Fellowship, and
several best paper awards.

<p class="blurb"> 
<span class="organizer">Mark Sherman</span>  
recently joined the MIT App Inventor team after completing his University
of Massachusetts Lowell doctoratal dissertation "Detecting 
Student Progress during Programming Activities by Analyzing Edit
Operations on their Blocks-based Programs". 
As a member of the UMass Lowell Engaging Computing Group, he worked
on several projects involving App Inventor, and has been an MIT 
Master Trainer for many years.
