<h1>Final Submission Instructions</h1>

<p>By the end of day on <span style="color:magenta">Wednesday, August 30, 2017</span>:

<ul>

<li>You must submit the camera-ready version of your paper.
<li>You must submit the IEEE copyright form.
<li>At least one author (the one presenting the paper) must register for the workshop.

</ul>

<p> Here are the steps to follow: 

<ol>

<li><b>Submit Your IEEE Copyright Form</b>

<p>This step can be done at any point in the process, but you might want to do it early so that co-authors have time to consult about it. 
It must be completed by <span style="color:magenta">Wednesday, August 30, 2017</span>.

<p><i>We are currently exploring using the IEEE's electronic copright submission system (eCF). Details will be posted soon.</i>

<li><b>Revise Your Submission</b>: 

<p>Revise your submission to address all of the comments of all the reviewers.

<li><b>Format Your Paper</b>

<p>All submissions must be created using the 8.5" x 11" (US Letter), Two-Column Format template (LaTeX or MS Word) provided at the IEEE author site: 

<blockquote><code>http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html</code></blockquote>

<p>If you use the LaTeX template, use the following \documentclass declaration; do *not* use the compsoc option.

<blockquote><code>\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}</code></blockquote>

<p>The page limits are as follows, depending on whether your submission was accepted as a full paper or a position statement: 

<ul>

<li> Full paper: 8 pages 
<li> Position statement: 4 pages 

</ul>

<p>If you added page numbers to your original submission, please remove them from your camera-ready version.<br><br>

<li><b>Create/validate your submission PDF</b>

<p>All camera-ready submissions must be PDF documents that have been
validated using IEEE's PDF eXpress Plus tool. You can choose either to
let PDF eXpress Plus create your final PDF from source or you can
validate a PDF you have created yourself. Only papers that pass
validation by PDF eXpress Plus are accepted by the IEEE Xplore digital
library.

<ol type="a">

<li>Begin by visiting the PDF eXpress Plus site at: 

<blockquote><a href="http://www.pdf-express.org/plus">http://www.pdf-express.org/plus</a></blockquote>

<ul>

<li>If you've visited this site before, log in with Conference ID <code>43120XP</code> and go to step 4c. 

<li> If this is your first visit to the site, click on the link "New
Users - Click Here" and fill in your information. You will need the
Conference ID, which is

<blockquote><code>43120XP</code></blockquote>

<p>You will also need to specify a password for this particular conference ID. 

<p>Click "Submit" when done and go to Step 4b. 

</ul>

<li> On the Create Account Page, fill in any missing information, click "Submit" when done, and then click "Continue".<br><br>

<li> On the Home -- Title Status page, click "Create New Title" and
enter some version of the title for your paper. (The title is not
official in any way; it is only used by you to distinguish submissions
if you have more than one). Click "Submit File for Checking or
Converting"<br><br>

<li> On the Upload File page, either (1) choose a PDF file to validate
or (2) choose a source file to convert to PDF (e.g. .doc/.docx). Then
click "Upload File" and read the message on the resulting page.

<p>Soon, you should receive an email from the system reporting the status of the validation/conversion. 

<ul>

<li> If the validation/conversion is successful, the email will say
so, but will <b>not</b> include the validated/converted PDF file as an
attachment. To see the validated/converted PDF file, go to step 4e.

<li> If the validation/conversion is unsuccessful, the email will give
hints on how to fix the problem. Go to step 4e and try again. If you
have problem validating a PDF file you saved from a .doc/.docx file,
you might instead try using PDF eXpress Plus to convert the .doc/.docx
file directly.<br><br>

</ul>

<li> Click "Continue" to return to the Home -- Title Status page. This
page shows the status of your paper(s). On this page you can:<br><br>

<ul>

<li> Click on a title to view the validated/converted PDF associated with that title. 

<li> Click on "Try Again" to retry validation/conversion for a paper 

<li> Click "Refresh File Status" to refresh the page.<br><br>

</ul>

</ol>

<li><b>Upload your final submission to PDF Express Plus</b>

<p>This step must be completed by the end of day on <span style="color:magenta">Wednesday, August 30, 2017</span>.

<p>For the B&amp;B 2017 workshop, you will use PDF eXpress Plus (<b>not</b> EasyChair) 
to upload the final version of your submission. 

<ol type="a">

<li> In PDF eXpress Plus, go to the Home -- Title Status page.<br><br>

<li> Click on the "Approve for Collection" link for the title you wish to submit.<br><br>

<li> On the resulting page, labeled IEEE PDF eXpress, you will be able
to change the default File Name for your PDF file. Please ignore the
advice on that page, and name your file using the following
convention:

<blockquote><code><i>lastNameOfPresentingAuthor</i>-<i>firstTitleWord</i>-<i>secondTitleWord</i></code></blockquote>

<p>E.g., presenting author Phil E. Buster of paper "Time Consuming Blocks" would use the <code>filename Buster-Time-Consuming.pdf</code>

<li> Click "Approve File for Collection" to submit your final version.<br><br>

</ol>

<li><b>Registration</b>

<p>In order for your paper to be published in the proceedings, it must be presented at the workshop
by one of the authors. At least one of the paper authors must register for the workshop by 
<span style="color:magenta">Wednesday, August 30, 2017</span> (end of day, same as the camera-ready deadline). 

<p>Workshop registration information can be found at 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2017/attending">https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2017/attending</a>

<p>You can register for the workshop without registering for the main
VL/HCC workshop. But please consider attending at least one day of the
VL/HCC workshop. One of the main benefits of holding the Blocks and
Beyond workshop with VL/HCC is cross-fertilization between the two
communities.

<p>Note: on the registration form, you will be asked to fill out two screens of information
before the screen labeled <i>Agenda</i>, on which you will indicate that you are registering
for the Blocks workshop. 

<li><b>Hotel reservations</b>

<p>Now is a good time to be thinking about hotel reservations. Hotel information is posted at
