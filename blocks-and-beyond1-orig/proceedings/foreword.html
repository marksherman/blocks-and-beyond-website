<h2>Foreword</h2>
<h3>Blocks and Beyond, 2015</h3>

<p>Welcome to the 2015 IEEE Blocks and Beyond Workshop (B&amp;B)!  

<p>Recently, there has been an explosion of interest in blocks
programming languages and related visual programming environments,
such as Scratch, Blockly, App Inventor, Snap!, Pencil Code,
Alice/Looking Glass, Greenfoot, TouchDevelop, and
AgentSheets/AgentCubes. Code.orgâ€™s Hour of Code and blocks-based
curricular activities have played a huge role in increasing the
popularity of blocks languages. These environments have introduced
programming and computational thinking to tens of millions, reaching
people of all ages and backgrounds.

<p>Despite their popularity, there has been remarkably little research
on the usability, effectiveness, or generalizability of affordances
from these environments. This workshop brings together educators,
researchers, and developers with experience in blocks languages with
the goal of beginning to distill testable hypotheses from the existing
folk knowledge of blocks-based programming environments and to
identify research questions and partnerships that can legitimize, or
discount, pieces of this knowledge.

<p>We are delighted that this workshop is being held in conjunction
with VL/HCC 2015 in Atlanta. This raises the profile of blocks
languages and encourages cross-fertilization between blocks language
researchers and the broader VL/HCC community.

<p>When we first started planning this workshop, we imagined an intimate gathering of about 15 to 20 people. So, we were astonished by the overwhelming response to our workshop. We received 52 submissions, underscoring a large untapped interest in blocks languages.

<p>Submissions were invited in two categories: position statements (1
to 3 pages describing an idea, research question, or work related to
the design, teaching, or study of blocks programming languages) or
papers (up to 6 pages describing previously unpublished work in the
blocks language area).  Of the 19 papers submitted, 14 (74%) were
accepted. Of the 32 position statements submitted, 22 (69%) were
accepted. (These statistics do not include a paper that was withdrawn
when the authors realized they could not attend the workshop.)  We
thank our Program Committee members for reviewing many more
submissions than we expected, and for doing so on a very short
timeline during prime summer vacation weeks.

<p>Between submission authors, members of the program and organizing
committees, and other interested parties, we are expecting about 60
attendees at B&amp;B. This large number raises many challenges for the
workshop schedule.  From the beginning, we wanted the workshop to
emphasize discussion, and not just be a mini-conference in which
papers are presented.  But having discussions with 60 participants is
not very fruitful.  So we decided on a model in which we would would
have 6 presentation/discussion sessions scheduled in two tracks over
three 1.5 hour time slots.  Each such session will begin with about 30
minutes of presentations and will be followed by an hour of
discussion. Having parallel tracks in a workshop is highly unusual,
but we saw no other way to handle the large number of accepted
submissions and preserve the discussion-oriented nature of the
workshop. These sessions will be preceded by a 1.5 hour demo/poster
session in which any attendee can present a poster or give a demo on a
blocks language topic.  At the end of the day, there will be a wrap-up
session summarizing the discussions of the 6 presentation/discussion
sessions and planning for the future.

<p>To further take advantage of having so many people interested in
blocks languages together in one place, we have allocated the day
after the workshop to informal meetings and discussions for interested
attendees.  Nearly two-thirds of the expected attendees have indicated
that they want to participate in these post-workshop discussions.

<p>We owe special thanks to the VL/HCC 2015 organizers for all their
hard work in helping to make B&amp;B a success. Scott Fleming gave us much
help and encouragement in the planning and organization of this
workshop. Eileen Kraemer did an extraordinary job finding additional
space and hotel rooms when the number of expected attendees
tripled. Jane Li provided valuable advice and flexibility in the
preparation of the proceedings.

<p>Most of all, we would like to thank everyone who submitted to
and/or will be attending the B&amp;B workshop in Atlanta. We are all
looking forward to the conversations that will take place and the
ideas that will emerge when so many blocks language enthusiasts are
together in one place.

<p>Sincerely,
