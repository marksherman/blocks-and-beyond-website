<h1>Revised Workshop Schedule</h1>

<p>This is the tentative schedule as of Oct. 14, 2015

<p>This will be a full-day workshop on <strong>Thursday, October 22</strong>
at the <a href="http://www.gatechhotel.com/">Georgia Tech Hotel and Conference Center</a>. 
<!--The exact schedule will depend on the number and background of participants and types 
of submission (position statements vs. papers). Below is a tentative schedule that gives 
a sense of what we have in mind.  We may change it to better suit the participants. -->

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Because it is rare for so many members of this community to gather in one place,
some participants are planning to stay at least part of 
<strong>Friday, October 23</strong> to continue conversations started the previous day. 
If you are planning to stay this day, please contact <a href="mailto:fturbak@wellesley.edu">Franklyn Turbak<a>.
