  blurb: "In this demo, participants will get to try the latest version of BlockPy, a new web-based programming environment built on Blockly and Skulpt with an emphasis on data science. Introductory learners can access real-world datasets such as weather reports and real-time stock data. As a platform for completing short programming problems, BlockPy can be configured to provide guiding feedback and report grades using LTI protocols. The environment also handles Mutual Language Translation, so that users can freely switch between blocks and text. The environment's powerful pedagogical features open the way for a number of interesting new research directions in both education and program analysis."

The language is designed to teach computation from a tangible, first-person perspective and help students integrate computation back into the physical world. We describe the language in general and reflect specifically on our recent implementation of its block interface."

Animated in-place transitions make the correspondence between the two views clear. In user experimentation, we found that users responded very favourably to the animated transitions and appreciated immediate overlaid error messages. We also found that a proportion of participants had serious difficulty with the drag-and-drop paradigm and that users who were less experienced with technology in general had greater enjoyment using the system. Tiled Grace is available in a web browser at http://ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~mwh/minigrace/tiled/",

However, StarLogo Nova's language and engine design now support concurrency and decentralized programming in a much more intuitive way, giving beginning programmers immediate access to this type of thinking.

After conducting several of such workshops we started noticing that participants engaged with the platform in one of four different styles: instruction follower, scene designer, dialogue story teller and action animator. We hope to reflect with viewers on why the study of styles of use in Alice could be important for visual languages and computer science education.'

	  blurb: "One of the keystone attributes of constructionist learning is that it is interest-driven, allowing users to instill their own personal interests in what they create. However, kids interests may not always lead them to learning more challenging skills. This leads to a concern about equity in who gets the most out of constructionist education. How do we consistently promote rigorous learning while still maintaining the student-centered, interest-driven approaches that define constructionism? In this poster we share one approach to building a more rigorous and equitable constructionist learning environment, by applying a studio design model of pedagogy from the arts to computer science in the creation of a set of three weeklong Scratch Camps. We share our Camp design, outline the learning theories informing it, and consider lessons learned from the experience.",
