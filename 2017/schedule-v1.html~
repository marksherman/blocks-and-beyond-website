<h1>Workshop Schedule</h1>

<p>The main workshop will be held on Tue. Oct. 10, 2017 at the 
<a href="http://www.marbleskidsmuseum.org/">Marbles Kids Museum</a>
in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. This workshop will include 
the presentation of approximately 20 submissions. Position statements
will be presented in 5-minute flash talks; full papers will be alloted
approximately 15 minutes. There will also be a demo and poster session. 

<p>A schedule will be posted after submisssion acceptances are determined. 

<p>Originally, a second workshop day (Mon. Oct. 9) was planned, but the 
number of submissions (26) did not justify a two-day workshop. 
Nevertheless, some informal activities may be be scheduled for the
late afternoon and evening of Mon. Oct. 09.
