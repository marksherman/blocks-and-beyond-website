<h1>Call for Demos and Posters</h1>









For planning purposes, we need to know by date goes here (e.g. Thu 9/7 or Wed 9/13) (1) who will be presenting a demo and/or poster and (2) the title and (3) an abstract of the topic. You can "sign up" for a demo/poster presentation by submitting a short abstract (at most a few paragraphs) to EasyChair in the Demo/Poster track of the workshop (URL link will go here);  for this option, you do not need to submit any PDF. Such abstracts will not appear in the IEEE proceedings but will be posted on the workshop website. 

We also offer the option for you to submit a longer (up to 2 pages) demo/poster summary document  that will appear in the proceedings. In order to keep a low bar for signing up for a demo/poster, a summary document is completely optional. Such a summary makes the most sense for (1) attendees who are not presenting a full paper or position statement or (2) accepted authors who wish to present a demo/poster on a topic different than their full paper or position statement. A demo/poster summary document should be formatted using the IEEE double-column article style. It should contain an abstract and may have references (where appropriate). Demo/poster summary documents should be submitted by date goes here (e.g. Thu 9/7 or Wed 9/13).  To submit a demo/poster summary document, submit both (1) the abstract of the document and (2) a PDF of the full summary document to EasyChair in the Demo/Poster track of the workshop (URL link will go here). Summary documents will be reviewed by the workshop organizers and you may be asked to revise them before they are published. Demo/poster summary documents will appear in the proceedings only if at least one of the authors registers by when? and actually participates in the playground session at the workshop. 

[Need a reminder blurb here about the Sep 8 early registration deadline if the demo/poster deadline is after Sep 8.]

If you have any questions about the demo/poster session, please email Lyn Turbak directly at fturbak@wellesley.edu.
