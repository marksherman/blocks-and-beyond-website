    "abstract":"NetsBlox is a visual blocks-based programming language extending Snap! with a few carefully selected abstractions to support distributed programming. In this paper, we argue that with the help of NetsBlox, some of the fundamental concepts of computer networking can be included in the high school computer science curriculum. Specifically, we describe a set of curricular units that would fit nicely in the AP Computer Science Principles course. High school students in two short-term studies showed great engagement and were able to complete simple computer networking tasks with NetsBlox.",

    "abstract":"We are currently developing PyBlocks, a blocks-based environment which allows novice programmers to construct and execute Python programs. An earlier paper gave an initial design in which Python\u2019s basic data types are represented using colors, every expression block is colored according to its type, and each unfilled slot contains color indicating all valid argument types. Whilst allowing simple programs to be constructed, a significant limitation of the initial design is the small number of supported types. In this paper we extend the design to include Python\u2019s most common built-in composite types (lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets) and to allow nesting of these where appropriate. Using example types from a pedagogical media computation library, we also show how other types may be supported. Together, these extensions provide almost any type novice Python programmers are likely to use.",

However, block environments that attempt to represent feature-rich languages, such as Python or Java, face serious usability and pedagogical challenges. How can the affordances and controls of a block be exposed, without over-complicating the block's interface and obscuring its meaning to the user? In this paper, we visually explore a number of interface mechanisms to reconfigure a block. We outline research questions to compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of these mechanisms, and call on the community to pursue these trade-offs further.",

    "abstract":"MUzECS is a musical alternative to the robotics module of Exploring Computer Science (ECS)\u2019s high school course. MUzECS encompasses a small interactive microcontroller board that allows students to create music, an offline Google Chrome app to program this board with blocks, and an accompanying high school curriculum. Our board\u2019s less expensive competitor is Adafruit\u2019s Circuit Playground, which also has more peripherals than the MUzECS board. But, existing curricula that use the Circuit Playground require constant online connectivity for the software, while the MUzECS software can function offline. Therefore, having the MUzECS software work with the Circuit Playground would be ideal for schools with inconsistent or otherwise poor internet connectivity and limited budgets. Furthermore, many of the existing blocks-based environments for physical computing use event-driven Javascript code. We suggest that a focus on blocks-based procedural programming would allow students to smoothly transition to the Arduino language. By extending compatibility of MUzECS software to include the Circuit Playground, we will offer a more affordable, more accessible final module to the ECS curriculum.",

The system chooses dynamically which puzzle to present to the user next,  based on the current user state. As the student is solving the puzzle, the system seeks to provide immediate actionable feedback to the user's actions. The application makes both of these decisions by relying on \"student events\" - a computer-readable encoding of atomic elements we consider \"important\" in the student code. This encoding also allows for some interesting analyses of how users tend to progress through our content, and what specific areas of the content need improvement.",

In this paper, we argue that blocks-based languages aimed at professional end-user developers face requirements that present challenges to the user interface design of such languages. We discuss three aspects that set potential professional use of block interfaces apart from educational use with children and students, and the implications for the design of blocks-based language editors. These aspects are that professionals: (1) require the editor to support high-productivity, (2) should not be limited by a simplified run-time environment, and (3) need the blocks editor to provide support for working with large programs. These three aspects provide research avenues for extending the usefulness of blocks-based language interfaces. We intend to explore these aspects with the design, development, and evaluation of a blocks-based prototyping system for web designers. We report some preliminary results from an initial user experience-study in which 4th-year web design students were exposed to a blocks-based version of a language they already knew.",

    "abstract":"In psychology and social science, Experience Sampling Method (ESM) studies are used to collect survey responses from participants on their behaviours, attitudes and contexts as they go about their everyday lives. Smartphone apps are an ideal medium for such studies - devices seldom leave their users, and can automatically sense surrounding context. However, researchers using ESM are not necessarily programmers and require tools for DIY app creation. Previous tools using web forms, text files, or flowchart paradigms are either insufficient to model the potential complexity of study protocols, or fail to provide a low threshold to entry. Blocks programming simultaneously lowers the barriers to creating simple study protocols, while facilitating the creation of sophisticated protocols. We discuss the design of \u2018Jeeves\u2019, our blocks-based environment for ESM studies, the advantages that blocks afford in ESM study design, and our current evaluation of Jeeves so far.",

    "abstract":"Learning to program is a difficult task, and high failure rates in introductory programming classes are common. Exacerbating high failure rates is the lack of a strong CS pipeline in the American K-12 system.  However, one promising approach to improving the CS pipeline is the development of block-based languages, such as Scratch.  Block-based languages are simpler than full-fledged industry versions, and have been shown to increase student motivation and self-efficacy. Expertise in a block-based language appears to transfer well, since successful \u201cScratchers\u201d have higher rates of success in college programming classes.  This could be explained by Scratch encouraging students to develop Computation Thinking skills. Computational Thinking (CT) is a loosely defined set of cognitive abilities, ranging from problem decomposition to abstraction and parallelization.  This project proposes an analysis of CT in Scratch textbooks.  Do the most commonly purchased books teach these cognitive abilities?  Beyond CT, do the books align with Scratch best practices?  The resulting analysis will document the pros and cons of each book, allowing Scratch teachers to select appropriate books for their individual situations.\r\n",

We investigate the use of procedures in MIT App Inventor, a web-based blocks programming environment for creating Android mobile apps. We explore how procedures are used \"in the wild\" by examining two datasets of App Inventor projects: all projects of ten thousand\nrandomly chosen users and all projects of all prolific users (those users with 20 or more projects). \n\nOur data analysis indicates that procedural abstraction is a concept that is learned over time by some App Inventor users, but it is used relatively infrequently, and features like parameters and returning values are used even more rarely. Procedures are most frequently called only once, indicating that they are often used to organize code rather than to reuse it. Surprisingly, 10% of declared procedures are never called, suggesting that this situation should be flagged by the environment.",

    "abstract":"Feedback is a critical element of learning and is relatively unexplored in the design and development of block-based languages. We present a block-based language for specifying feedback as part of a broader research agenda. In this language a feedback specification has an Observe element and a Feedback element. The Observe element corresponds to a pattern in the block program, the program's execution trace, or the program's output. The Feedback element is a set of items that can be presented whenever the corresponding Observe element is present or absent. An observation is performed on execution, when requested by the student, or on any change to the programming blocks. The later checking enables immediate feedback: guidance given about the block program as it is being constructed. Immediate feedback motivates a block-based specification because the pattern to be observed is itself a collection of blocks. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.",

To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel pedagogy uniting logical reasoning with proofs of program correctness along with a proof assistant, Orca, that helps students author proofs in this do- main. One of the defining features of OROrcaC2A is that it has a blocks-based surface language of proof to reduce friction when adopting the tool in the classroom. We report on the current progress on Orca, in particular, its blocks-based interface, current design consideration, and our plans for evaluating the system.",

In various experiments, referenced in this paper, we observed how objects (tangibles) augmented with digital properties \u2013 that is, tangible user interface (TUI) objects \u2013 can help develop CT skills. We investigate which paradigm can be used to introduce CT skills with TUIs. By drawing on past experience, we conclude that block-oriented programming provides a suitable answer to our research questions. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for implementing block-oriented programmable objects that we believe can help end-users learn CT skills. ",

Using a customized language built with the Blockly library, we created a block-based interface for programming a one-armed industrial robot. In this paper, we present our block-based robot programming language called Robot Blockly, focusing on how the various affordances of block-based programming were utilized to make the challenge of robot programming more accessible. We also present results from a small-scale study showing adults with no prior programming experience successfully programming a virtual robot to accomplish a pick and place task.

One would think that the issue of software quality is inapplicable in this programming domain. Nevertheless, as recent research shows, block-based programs, written by novice programmers, exhibit recurring quality problems. Although block-based software is not intended for production environments, poor quality can be detrimental to achieving the educational objectives the very use of blocks aims for. Specifically, as we and other researchers have been discovering, introductory programmers, as they gain proficiency, tend to retain poor programming habits, thus continuing to introduce recurring quality problems into their programs. Evidence also indicates that poorly written code is less likely to be reused, thus hindering the potential benefits of this peer-learning mechanism. These findings call for a synergistic effort from educators and tool developers to address the issue of software quality in the context of block-based programming. This effort will require innovating both in the realm of introductory computing curricula and software infrastructure to improve software quality.",
