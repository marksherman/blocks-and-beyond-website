    "abstract":"Feedback is a critical element of learning and is relatively unexplored in the design and development of block-based languages. We present a block-based language for specifying feedback as part of a broader research agenda. In this language a feedback specification has an Observe element and a Feedback element. The Observe element corresponds to a pattern in the block program, the program's execution trace, or the program's output. The Feedback element is a set of items that can be presented whenever the corresponding Observe element is present or absent. An observation is performed on execution, when requested by the student, or on any change to the programming blocks. The later checking enables immediate feedback: guidance given about the block program as it is being constructed. Immediate feedback motivates a block-based specification because the pattern to be observed is itself a collection of blocks. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.",

    "abstract":"Reasoning about programs is an important component of computational\nthinking.  Laws of computation give meaning to the formalisms in\nwhich programs are expressed, and can be used to predict or explain\nprogram behavior, or to uncover bugs.  This paper presents Calypso,\na language inspired by Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab but designed for\nprogramming actual mobile robots rather than characters in a\nvirtual world.  The initial implementation of Calypso uses the\nCozmo robot by Anki.\n\nLike Kodu, the Calypso interpreter can be described by five key laws.  An\nunderstanding of the laws and how to apply them constitutes a mental\nmodel of computation.  Calypso provides a variety of affordances and\nscaffolding techniques to foster development of effective mental\nmodels and facilitate computational thinking.",

    "abstract":"Block-oriented programming environments, such as Scratch and AppInventor, have become mainstream and have helped introduce non-programmers to algorithmic thinking; that is, to computational thinking (CT) skills. In various experiments, referenced in this paper, we observed how objects (tangibles) augmented with digital properties \u2013 that is, tangible user interface (TUI) objects \u2013 can help develop CT skills. We investigate which paradigm can be used to introduce CT skills with TUIs. By drawing on past experience, we conclude that block-oriented programming provides a suitable answer to our research questions. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for implementing block-oriented programmable objects that we believe can help end-users learn CT skills. ",

    "abstract":"The block-based approach to programming is an effective way to engage young learners in programming and the powerful ideas of computing. In this paper, we explore the potential of this same approach being used in a very different programming context: industrial robotics. Using a customized language built with the Blockly library, we created a block-based interface for programming a one-armed industrial robot. In this paper, we present our block-based robot programming language called Robot Blockly, focusing on how the various affordances of block-based programming were utilized to make the challenge of robot programming more accessible. We also present results from a small-scale study showing adults with no prior programming experience successfully programming a virtual robot to accomplish a pick and place task. The contribution of this work is in showing the potential for block-based programming beyond young learners and classrooms.",

    "abstract":"Block-based programming environments make learning to program easier by allowing learners to focus on concepts rather than syntax. However, these environments offer little support when learners encounter difficulty with programming concepts themselves, especially in the absence of instructors. Textual programming environments increasingly use AI and data mining to provide intelligent, adaptive support for students, similar to human tutoring, which has been shown to improve performance and learning outcomes. In this position paper, we argue that block-based programming environments should also include these features. This paper gives an overview of promising research in intelligent support for programming and highlights the challenges and opportunities for applying this work to block-based programming.",

    "abstract":"Block-based programming has proven extraordinarily successful as a pedagogical tool for learning the fundamentals of computing via an exploratory, unconstrained, and hands-on approach. One would think that the issue of software quality is inapplicable in this programming domain. Nevertheless, as recent research shows, block-based programs, written by novice programmers, exhibit recurring quality problems. Although block-based software is not intended for production environments, poor quality can be detrimental to achieving the educational objectives the very use of blocks aims for. Specifically, as we and other researchers have been discovering, introductory programmers, as they gain proficiency, tend to retain poor programming habits, thus continuing to introduce recurring quality problems into their programs. Evidence also indicates that poorly written code is less likely to be reused, thus hindering the potential benefits of this peer-learning mechanism. These findings call for a synergistic effort from educators and tool developers to address the issue of software quality in the context of block-based programming. This effort will require innovating both in the realm of introductory computing curricula and software infrastructure to improve software quality.",

An earlier paper gave an initial design in which Python\u2019s basic data types are represented using colors, every expression block is colored according to its type, and each unfilled slot contains color indicating all valid argument types. Whilst allowing simple programs to be constructed, a significant limitation of the initial design is the small number of supported types. In this paper we extend the design to include Python\u2019s most common built-in composite types (lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets) and to allow nesting of these where appropriate. Using example types from a pedagogical media computation library, we also show how other types may be supported. Together, these extensions provide almost any type novice Python programmers are likely to use.",

However, block environments that attempt to represent feature-rich languages, such as Python or Java, face serious usability and pedagogical challenges. How can the affordances and controls of a block be exposed, without over-complicating the block's interface and obscuring its meaning to the user?

As part of this application, we developed an AST-based JavaScript editor for the phone. The visual representation of the code is built using the AST as the source of truth, and user actions modify the AST rather than a code string, much like a block code editor. At the same time, we style this visual representation to look as similar as possible to syntax-highlighted, formatted JavaScript code in a text based editor.

In this paper, we argue that blocks-based languages aimed at professional end-user developers face requirements that present challenges to the user interface design of such languages. We discuss three aspects that set potential professional use of block interfaces apart from educational use with children and students, and the implications for the design of blocks-based language editors. These aspects are that professionals: (1) require the editor to support high-productivity, (2) should not be limited by a simplified run-time environment, and (3) need the blocks editor to provide support for working with large programs. These three aspects provide research avenues for extending the usefulness of blocks-based language interfaces. We intend to explore these aspects with the design, development, and evaluation of a blocks-based prototyping system for web designers. We report some preliminary results from an initial user experience-study in which 4th-year web design students were exposed to a blocks-based version of a language they already knew.",

Smartphone apps are an ideal medium for such studies - devices seldom leave their users, and can automatically sense surrounding context. However, researchers using ESM are not necessarily programmers and require tools for DIY app creation. Previous tools using web forms, text files, or flowchart paradigms are either insufficient to model the potential complexity of study protocols, or fail to provide a low threshold to entry. Blocks programming simultaneously lowers the barriers to creating simple study protocols, while facilitating the creation of sophisticated protocols. We discuss the design of \u2018Jeeves\u2019, our blocks-based environment for ESM studies, the advantages that blocks afford in ESM study design, and our current evaluation of Jeeves so far.",

Our analysis supports that the number of abstractions may be a useful predictor for the difficulty (defined for our data set as the average number of attempts) in solving Quizly exercises.

Procedures are most frequently called only once, indicating that they are often used to organize code rather than to reuse it.

    "abstract":"There is wide consensus that most people should have some programming capability, whether to control the Internet of Things, or to analyze the world of data around them.\nWhile some people focus on teaching conventional text-based languages like Javascript or Python, there is evidence that visual programming languages are more accessible for naive programmers.\n\nVisual programming languages fall into two broad categories: block-based, imperative programming, or flow-based, functional programming.\nHowever there have not been empirical studies to evaluate the relative merits of the two categories.\n\nThis paper describes a study of hundreds of random people via Amazon Mechanical Turk attempting to program some simple problems in one or the other of two environments designed to be as similar as possible, except for the choice of paradigm.",

    "abstract":"While formal mathematical reasoning is the cornerstone of computer science, undergraduates often fail to appreciate the value of mathematical proof in their studies. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel pedagogy uniting logical reasoning with proofs of program correctness along with a proof assistant, Orca, that helps students author proofs in this do- main. One of the defining features of OROrcaC2A is that it has a blocks-based surface language of proof to reduce friction when adopting the tool in the classroom. We report on the current progress on Orca, in particular, its blocks-based interface, current design consideration, and our plans for evaluating the system.",
