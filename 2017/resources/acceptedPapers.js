    "abstract":"We present a block-based language for specifying feedback to novice learners about the programs they are constructing in a block-based programming language. In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.",

    "abstract":"Reasoning about programs is an important component of computational\nthinking.  Laws of computation give meaning to the formalisms in\nwhich programs are expressed, and can be used to predict or explain\nprogram behavior, or to uncover bugs.  This paper presents Calypso,\na language inspired by Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab but designed for\nprogramming actual mobile robots rather than characters in a\nvirtual world.  The initial implementation of Calypso uses the\nCozmo robot by Anki.\n\nLike Kodu, the Calypso interpreter can be described by five key laws.  An\nunderstanding of the laws and how to apply them constitutes a mental\nmodel of computation.  Calypso provides a variety of affordances and\nscaffolding techniques to foster development of effective mental\nmodels and facilitate computational thinking.",

    "abstract":"Block-oriented programming environments, such as Scratch and AppInventor, have become mainstream and have helped introduce non-programmers to algorithmic thinking; that is, to computational thinking (CT) skills. In various experiments, referenced in this paper, we observed how objects (tangibles) augmented with digital properties \u2013 that is, tangible user interface (TUI) objects \u2013 can help develop CT skills. We investigate which paradigm can be used to introduce CT skills with TUIs. By drawing on past experience, we conclude that block-oriented programming provides a suitable answer to our research questions. Furthermore, we introduce a framework for implementing block-oriented programmable objects that we believe can help end-users learn CT skills. ",

    "abstract":"The block-based approach to programming is an effective way to engage young learners in programming and the powerful ideas of computing. In this paper, we explore the potential of this same approach being used in a very different programming context: industrial robotics. Using a customized language built with the Blockly library, we created a block-based interface for programming a one-armed industrial robot. This paper presents a block-based robot programming language called Robot Blockly, focusing on how the various affordances of block-based programming were utilized to make the challenge of robot programming more accessible. We also present results from a small-scale study showing adults with no prior programming experience successfully programming a virtual robot to accomplish a pick and place task. The contribution of this work is in showing the potential for block-based programming beyond young learners and classrooms.",

    "abstract":"Block-based programming environments make learning to program easier by allowing learners to focus on concepts rather than syntax. However, these environments offer little support when learners encounter difficulty with programming concepts themselves, especially in the absence of instructors. Textual programming environments increasingly use AI and data mining to provide intelligent, adaptive support for students, similar to human tutoring, which has been shown to improve performance and learning outcomes. In this position paper, we argue that block-based programming environments should also include these features. This paper gives an overview of promising research in intelligent support for programming and highlights the challenges and opportunities for applying this work to block-based programming.",

    "abstract":"Block-based programming has proven extraordinarily successful as a pedagogical tool for learning the fundamentals of computing via an exploratory, unconstrained, and hands-on approach. One would think that the issue of software quality is inapplicable in this programming domain. Nevertheless, as recent research shows, block-based programs, written by novice programmers, exhibit recurring quality problems. Although block-based software is not intended for production environments, poor quality can be detrimental to achieving the educational objectives the very use of blocks aims for. Specifically, as we and other researchers have been discovering, introductory programmers, as they gain proficiency, tend to retain poor programming habits, thus continuing to introduce recurring quality problems into their programs. Evidence also indicates that poorly written code is less likely to be reused, thus hindering the potential benefits of this peer-learning mechanism. These findings call for a synergistic effort from educators and tool developers to address the issue of software quality in the context of block-based programming. This effort will require innovating both in the realm of introductory computing curricula and software infrastructure to improve software quality.",

In the initial design of PyBlocks, Python’s basic data types and lists are represented using colors, every expression block is colored according to its type, and each unfilled slot contains color indicating all valid argument types. In this paper we extend the design to include Python’s most common built-in composite types (lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets) and to allow nesting of these where appropriate. Using example types from a pedagogical media computation library, we also show how further types may be supported. Together, these extensions provide almost any type novice Python programmers are likely to use.",

However, block environments that attempt to represent feature-rich languages, such as Python or Java, face serious usability and pedagogical challenges. How can the affordances and controls of a block be exposed, without over-complicating the block's interface and obscuring its meaning to the user? In this paper, we visually explore a number of interface mechanisms to reconfigure a block. We outline research questions to compare and contrast the advantages and disadvantages of these mechanisms, and call on the community to pursue these trade-offs further.",

    "abstract": "The current generation of block languages, with its focus on teaching programming to novices, has not been designed for professionals. In this paper, we argue that blocks-based languages aimed at professional end-user developers face requirements that present challenges to the user interface design of such languages. We discuss three aspects that set potential professional use of block interfaces apart from educational use with children and students, and their implications for the design of blocks-based language editors. These aspects are that professionals: (1) require the editor to support high-productivity, (2) should not be limited by a simplified run-time environment, and (3) need the blocks editor to provide support for working with large programs. These three aspects provide research avenues for extending the usefulness of blocks-based language interfaces. We intend to explore these aspects with the design and development, of a blocks-based prototyping system for web designers. We report some preliminary results from an initial user experience-study in which 4th-year web design students were exposed to a blocks-based version of a language they already knew.",

Smartphones afford an ideal platform for ESM study applications as devices seldom leave their users, and can automatically sense surrounding context to augment subjective survey responses. ESM studies are employed in fields such as psychology and social science where researchers are not necessarily programmers and require tools for application creation. Previous tools using web forms, text files, or flowchart paradigms are either insufficient to model the potential complexity of study protocols, or fail to provide a low threshold to entry. We demonstrate that blocks programming simultaneously lowers the barriers to creating simple study protocols, while enabling the creation of increasingly sophisticated protocols. We discuss the design of Jeeves, our blocks-based environment for ESM studies, and explain advantages that blocks afford in ESM study design.",

However, many of the existing environments do not support synchronous collaboration. Collaboration is a critical component of computer science practice and CS education. We therefore argue that features to support collaboration could significantly enhance existing and new block-based programming environments. We review existing block-based programming environments, suggest design ideas for supporting synchronous collaboration, and evaluate environments that currently support some of these features.",

    "abstract":"This interactive demo will invite participants to discuss the trade-offs of different kinds of block interfaces. Block interfaces are a powerful way to scaffold learners, but can hide details of the programming language. Further, the affordances of the block (buttons, mutators, editable text boxes, etc.) can work to reduce students' cognitive load, but can also unintentionally increase the cognitive load too. To concretize the discussion, various possible interfaces will be shown in BlockPy, a web-based Python environment built on Blockly. Additionally, advanced Python code snippets that are unrepresentable in the environment will be demonstrated, to discuss what (if any) limits there are for block-representations of traditional languages. Although the initial conversation will be centered on Python and BlockPy, the presenters hope that the participants will broaden the conversation to other environments and to block-based interfaces in general.",

    "abstract":"This demo will showcase iSnap, an extension of the block-based, novice programming environment Snap!. iSnap is designed to support students when they get stuck on a programming assignment by providing on-demand hints and feedback that suggest how the student can bring their code closer to a correct solution. iSnap's hints are generated without the need for expert domain engineering, using a data-driven algorithm that recommends edits to a student's code based on how other students previously solved the same problem correctly. iSnap supports students with two types of feedback. In the first type of feedback, iSnap highlights the student's code to indicate blocks that likely do not belong in a correct solution, as well as blocks that belong, but may be in the wrong location. This feedback is designed to check the student's work and identify likely errors. If a student is still stuck and does not know how to proceed, iSnap can annotate their code with next step hints, suggesting where additional blocks of code should be inserted. These suggestions are generated by comparing a student's code to the best-matching correct solution in iSnap's database of student- or expert-provided solutions.\r\n\r\nDuring the demo, attendees will be able to test iSnap on a variety of assignments, with extra debugging information available to demonstrate how the system is adapting to their current code to provide relevant hints. An author will be present to explain the features of iSnap and how the data-driven hints are generated. In addition to the live demo, attendees will also be able to access a demo, public datasets and relevant papers afterwards at iSnap's website, http://go.ncsu.edu/isnap.",

    "abstract":"This demo is about TAPASPlay, a system that combines Game Based Learning with Tangible User Interfaces and Virtual Reality to foster Computational Thinking (CT) skills in an innovative way. Two players are asked to play the role of alchemists who must forge swords and shields to fight each other. Swords and shields are created through a puzzle-based approach with a Tangible Interface using the two players\u2019 smartphones and displayed on a tabletop surface. Finally, the players will have to wear their cardboards and enjoy the battle between two characters, one for each player, in Virtual Reality.\r\n\r\nIn a recent study [1] we introduced TAPAS (TAngible Programmable Augmented Surface), a Blocks Programming Environment that allows users to develop simple workflows by assembling different services using their smartphones as tangible interfaces. The interaction is carried out using tangible objects (i.e. smartphones) and the digital blocks are projected over a tabletop surface, making it fun and easy to use. \r\nIn TAPASPlay our system has been extended to include a Game-Based Learning (GBL) approach to foster CT skills. Since digital games are attractive and engaging for all groups of people, GBL has been proposed as one pedagogical framework for developing CT skills in an innovative way [2]. Currently, the literature in GBL focuses on two popular approaches to facilitate the development of CT skills and learning of introductory programming: learning through designing games and learning through\r\ngame-play. While the first approach has been extensively studied (e.g. Scratch, Alice and AgentSheets) the game-play approach is quite in its infancy; indeed, few studies demonstrate how game-play can be associated with CT and how the education of introductory programming can be supported by playing games [3]. \r\nThe novelty of TAPASPlay is to combine game-play with Tangible User Interfaces and Virtual Reality to teach Computational Thinking skills. The game is intended for an audience with little or no experience in programming, e.g. students, practitioners, designers, and likely to be interested in acquiring CT skills that allow them to carry out end-user development activities [4].\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] Turchi, T., Malizia, A.

    "abstract":"StarLogo Nova is an online tool for students and teachers to create and study agent-based models. It combines a blocks-based programming language, an instancing 3D rendering engine, and a pseudo-parallel execution engine to enable users to simulate systems with thousands or tens of thousands of interacting parts. Currently used by Project GUTS (Growing Up Thinking Scientifically), a nation-wide program for integrating computational modeling into middle school science classes, StarLogo Nova has over 80,000 users and 500,000 projects projects created.\r\n\r\nStarLogo Nova 2.0 is a new release that replaces the prior version's Flash-based renderer and execution engine with a Javascript version. In the process, we have revised several central UI designs to address issues that have been identified over the past two years. We have made it simpler to create and configure \"widgets\" (user-created UI elements), revised our block editing layout and functionality, and overhauled the process for creating and modifying properties of \"breeds\" (agent classes). We also gained performance by transpiling our blocks into Javascript function calls, rather than interpreting them in the engine. This has opened a new potential avenue of research into allowing users to switch between a StarLogo blocks and a Javascript view of the model.\r\n\r\nIn this demo/poster we will describe and demonstrate some of these design changes, and discuss their impacts on the typical workflow of a new user, the contents of a typical project, and new areas for potential research.",

Blocks based programming is used for novice programmers learning to code.  One of the major aspects of blocks based environments for programming is the visual queues one can get from the block specification itself.  As student code is being observed in a blocks state, it makes sense that instructors quickly learn to recognize various visual patterns in student code; this lends itself to making a blocks based language for specifying feedback as well. In addition to having this visual matching, it lowers the bar for entry level instructors teaching instructors in giving feedback. This poster surveys the difficulties of finding these patterns, the difficulties of creating and using such a specification, as well as our current work on creating this specification.",

Grasshopper is able to make two types of real-time decisions based on the user's current performance: selecting an appropriate piece of feedback when the student is in the middle of solving a puzzle; and selecting the most appropriate next puzzle when the student is done with the current puzzle. For both of these decisions, Grasshopper relies on \"student events\": definitions of things that are noteworthy when present in student code (sometimes in the context of the current puzzle).\r\n\r\nThis poster presentation illustrates the student event system, and how it is used to make these decisions, using an example of a hypothetical student going through the process of selecting and solving a single puzzle (\"Dash of Random\").

Here I present different representations of projects that could potentially be used to identify App Inventor projects that have structural similarities to each other, e.g., projects created by users following tutorials. I compare the different representations based solely on how accurately they predict the correct tutorial from a labeled data set. The results suggest that we use both blocks and components from a project, apply TF-IDF to the counts of each feature, and measure distance or similarity in terms of a generalized Jaccard distance. This work lays the foundation for being able to find clusters of similar projects to distinguish original from unoriginal projects and to be able to filter out similar projects when trying to determine a user's skill level.",

Using PyBlocks, learners use blocks that contain Python code, and constructed programs respect conventional Python code formatting throughout the connected blocks. As well as helping to guarantee the syntactic validity of programs, PyBlocks aims to reduce the occurrence of run-time errors, a source of learner frustration with dynamic languages, by ensuring that constructed programs will remain well-typed during execution. PyBlocks attempts to promote student understanding of how data types are used in their programs by representing them using color: each expression block is colored according to its type, and each unfilled hole contains colors which indicate valid argument types. The current version of PyBlocks supports Python's basic types and lists, and is built on Blockly and Skulpt.\r\n",

In this regard, every block is a little form. FreeCoffee is a blocks-based language whose editor goes well beyond terse slot labels and communicates the meaning of a block using complete grammatical sentences. These sentence-blocks still contain input-fields and drop-down menus for user-input, and will, in response to user input, adapt both their structure and their wording to keep the sentence grammatically correct. Sentences structure can also be changed in order to add optional features to the block. This sentence-oriented blocks-editor was designed for a domain specific language used in a multimedia design course. The abstractions and semantics of this language are far removed from mainstream scripting languages, and some of its structures were complex. Still, the language interface helped to enable students with almost no training to create interactive multimedia productions. \r\n",

After reviewing the challenges for learners, we suggest some ideas for helping both teachers and child learners make the transition to 3D. We will present a plan for further research on this topic.\r\n",

    "abstract":"GP is a new, general-purpose blocks language that is powerful yet easy to learn. GP users can write programs that generate graphics, manipulate images and sounds, analyze data, simulate scientific ideas, use cloud data, interact with the physical world, and more.\n\nExperienced GP users can create and share extensions that add new blocks and facilities to GP. For example, a teacher might create a library of blocks for manipulating sound, then share that extension with their students. GP extensions are written in the GP blocks language, so extension writers do not need to install or learn any other programming language.\n\nIn education, GP is a natural next step after Scratch, ideal for grades 8-12, introductory college-level computer science classes, or adding a hands-on computing component to courses in science, math, and the arts.\n\nGP is also great for anyone who wants to make simple apps but doesn’t want to deal with complex languages and tools designed for professional software developers. A GP project can be exported as a stand-alone executable or deployed on the web.\n\nWebsite: gpblocks.org",
