# Call for Participation

## Scope and Goals
Blocks programming environments represent program syntax trees as compositions of visual blocks. They are an increasingly popular way to introduce
programming and computational thinking; 
tens of millions of people have used tools like 
Scratch, Blockly, App Inventor, Snap!, Pencil Code, Alice/Looking
Glass, AgentSheets/AgentCubes, and Code.org's curricula. 
But blocks programming is not just for beginners; environments like GP and
domain-specific blocks languages are targeted at hobbyists, scientists. and other
casual programmers. 

Capitalizing on the energy and enthusiasm from the
 <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~blocks-and-beyond/1">1st Blocks and Beyond Workshop</a> in Atlanta
in 2015, this workshop aims to continue studying the 
usability, effectiveness, and generalizability of affordances of these
environments and their associated pedagogies. 
The workshop will bring
together educators and researchers with experience in blocks languages, as
well as members of the broader VL/HCC community who wish to examine this area
more deeply. We seek participants with diverse expertise, including, but not
limited to: design of programming environments, instruction with these
environments, the learning sciences, data analytics, usability, and more.


The workshop will be a generative discussion that sets the stage for
future work and collaboration. It will include participant presentations and
demonstrations that frame the discussion, followed by reflection on the state
of the field and smaller working-group discussion and brainstorming sessions.

## Suggested Topics for Discussion

* Who uses blocks programming environments and why? What do they create
    in these environments, and how satisfied are they with their creations?

* Which features of blocks environments help or hinder users? How do we know? Which of these features are worth incorporating into more traditional
IDEs?  What helpful features are missing?

* How can blocks environments and associated curricular materials be made more accessible to everyone, 
especially those with disabilities?

* Can blocks programming appeal to a wider range of interests (e.g., by allowing connections to
different types of devices, web services, data sources, etc.)?

* What are the best ways to introduce programming to novices and to
support their progression towards mastery? Do these approaches differ for
for learners of computing basics and for makers? 

* What are the conceptual and practical hurdles encountered by novice
users of blocks languages when they face the transition to text languages
and traditional programming communities? What can be done to reduce these
hurdles?

* How can we best harness online communities to support growth through
teaching, motivating, and providing inspiration and feedback?

* What roles should collaboration play in blocks programming? How can environments support that collaboration? 
<!--What kinds of roles should collaboration play in blocks environments?
What problems should we attempt to address using collaboration and what
kinds of communication are necessary? How can environments support that
collaboration most easily? Is real-time co-editing of code really a
desirable end-state, or is there another model that we should seek to
support?-->

* In these environments, what data can be collected, and how can that
data be analyzed to determine answers to questions like those above?  How
can we use data to answer larger scale questions about early experiences
with programming?

* What are the lessons learned (both positive and negative) from
creating first programming environments that can be shared with future
environment designers?
